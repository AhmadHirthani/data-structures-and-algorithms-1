# Array Reverse
i have some knowledge with binarysearch before 

## Challenge
build binary search algorthem without using biult in functions that will take an array and a key and the function will return the index of the key if its in the array or -1 if not 

## Approach & Efficiency
i will use while loop to check if the left space from the array if its bigger from the right side that mean its not in the array
